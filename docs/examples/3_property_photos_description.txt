INSPECTOR RECOMMENDATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This mobile home is in GOOD overall condition with no major structural
or safety concerns. The property has been well-maintained by the current
owner. The identified repairs are mostly cosmetic or preventive in nature.

✅ RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE with the following conditions:
  1. Address roof rust within 30 days to prevent future leaks
  2. Budget $4,500-$7,000 for immediate/short-term repairs
  3. Plan for HVAC replacement in next 1-3 years
  4. All repairs are standard and can be handled by local contractors

The asking price of $32,500 is BELOW MARKET VALUE considering the
property's condition. With $5,000-7,000 in repairs, the total investment
of $37,500-39,500 is still significantly below the $45k-48k market value,
creating immediate equity for the buyer.

This property would be:
✅ Suitable for owner-occupancy (minimal move-in repairs needed)
✅ Excellent for rental investment (strong rental demand in area)
✅ Good for flip/resale (repair, rent out, or resell for profit)
